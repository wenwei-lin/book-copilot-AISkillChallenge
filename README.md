### Project Overview
The inference end of this project is based on the open-source framework [Langchain-ChatChat](https://github.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat) with the following improvements:
+ Utilizes Azure OpenAI Embed and Azure OpenAI Chat models for question-answering.
+ Adds Langchain's summarization feature, allowing for embedding more related knowledge repositories at once and summarizing before answering, significantly improving accuracy.
+ Utilizes vector caching to reduce the cost of repetitive embeddings.

The frontend of this project is based on the open-source project [LangChain Chat - Next.js](https://github.com/zahidkhawaja/langchain-chat-nextjs) with the following enhancements:
+ Connects to a custom inference end.
+ Displays indexes of relevant documents in robot responses.

### Knowledge Repository Contents
Currently, the demo contains two books and our reading notes:
+ Good with Words.pdf
+ Six Walks in the Fictional Woods.txt
+ Bits of Note.csv

We've named this knowledge repository "Books," and users can input questions to obtain corresponding answers.

### Demo Access
+ We've deployed the demo on Azure Static Web App, and you can access it [here](https://wonderful-sea-0b60a9b00.3.azurestaticapps.net/).
+ Please note that this demo is for showcase purposes only and has low capacity. If you require a better experience, we recommend deploying it on your own.

### Future Work
+ Add a book uploading feature to the frontend. Currently, the framework supports real-time file uploads and updates, but due to limitations with the Azure OpenAI Embed model, uploading models may cause frontend delays. Currently, only backend file uploads and vectorization are supported. We plan to address this issue in the future.
+ Support online PDF reading and highlight embedded results.
